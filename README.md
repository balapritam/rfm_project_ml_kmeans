# 🚀 Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering 🚀

🚀 Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering 🚀
I just completed an exciting project on customer behavior analysis for an e-commerce platform. Using the popular RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model, I was able to segment customers into distinct groups: Silver, Gold, and Diamond.

🔍 Approach:
•	Data Processing: Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset to extract meaningful insights.
•	RFM Analysis: Calculated Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values for each customer.
•	K-Means Clustering: Applied the K-Means algorithm to group customers into segments. To ensure the best results, I used the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
📈 Outcome: This clustering technique enabled a more targeted approach to customer engagement, allowing businesses to tailor marketing strategies based on customer segments. The results showed clear distinctions in purchasing behaviors, providing actionable insights for improving customer retention and satisfaction.
